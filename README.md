# belly-button-challenge

For this challenge, I created an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset contains catalogs of different microbes that colonize in the human navel. 
Fun Fact: the dataset used to create my dashboard reveals that a small amount of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, the rest in the dataset are labeled as rare. 

Dashboard Features:
- Bar Chart: this displays the top 10 OTUs found in certain individuals. The dropdown menu helps users interchange between the samples in this study.

- Bubble Chart: Displays each sample of OTUs present in a certain sample 

- Metadata: demostrates an individual's demographic information from the sample that was chosen

- These charts are subject to change when the user filters through the different samples from the dropdown menu. 

The app is live and can be accessed through GitHub Pages, I have also included the url below:
